1. 分支: branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with the main line. Some people refer to Git's branching model as its `killer feature`, and it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.
2. 一些概念: `local branch`, `HEAD`, `branch`
3. Because a branch in Git is actually a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to, branches are cheap to create and destroy.Creating a new branch is as quick and simple as writing 41 bytes to a file (40 characters and a newline).
4. git-flow, 梳理出我们自己的flow
5. It’s important to remember when you’re doing all this that these branches are completely local. When you’re branching and merging, everything is being done only in your Git repository — there is no communication with the server.
6. Nevertheless, a more common way is to take advantage of remote-tracking branches.
7. Generally it’s better to simply use the fetch and merge commands explicitly as the magic of git pull can often be confusing.
