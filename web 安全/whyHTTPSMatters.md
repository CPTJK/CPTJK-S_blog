# why HTTPS matters

## HTTPS protect the integrity of your website

HTTPS helps prevent intruder from tampering with the communication between your website and your user's browser. Intruder include intentionally malicious attackers, and legitimate but intrusive companies, such as ISPs or hotels that inject ads into pages.

Intruders exploit unprotected communication to trick your user into giving up sensitive information or installing malware, or to insert their own advertisement into your resources. For example, some third parties inject advertisement into website that potentially break user experience and create security vulnerabilities.

Intruders exploit every unprotected resources that travels between website and your users. Images, cookies, scripts, HTML... they're are all exploitable. Intrusion can occur at any point in the network, including a user's machine, a WiFi Hotspot, or a compromised ISP, just to name a few.

## HTTPS protects the privacy and security of your users

HTTPS prevents intruder from being able to passively listen to communications between your website and your users.

One common misconception about HTTPS is that the only website that need HTTPS are those that handle sensitive communication. Every unprotected HTTP request can potentially reveal information about the behavior and identities of your users. Although a single visit to one of your unprotected websites may seem benign, some intruders look at the aggregate browsing activities of your users to make inferences about their behaviors and intentions, and to de-anoymize their identities. For example,employees might inadvertently disclose sensitive health conditions to their employer just by reading unprotected medial articles.

## HTTPS is the future of the web

Powerful, new web platform features, such as taking pictures or recording audio with `getUserMedia()` enabling offline App experience with service workers, or building progressive web apps, require explicit permission from the user before executing. Many older APIs are also being updated to require permission to execute, such as the Geolocation API. HTTPS is a key component to the permission workflow for both these new features and updated APIs.
